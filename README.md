# ReadMe Generator

## Getting Started

This homework we were required to use our skills in node.js. We were tasked using the user story to create a README Generator which would create a README.md file based on inputs from the user. The user would be prompted to answer a series of questions and those answers would define the result of the README.

This project was pretty simple, but helped improve the knowledge we had learnt from the previous week, I also had to learn about inquirer.js to answer the questions and also to direct questions to other questions based on the answer of previous questions.
